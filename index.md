subheading: About Me

Hi, I'm Kymani, a senior majoring in Physics with a minor in Mathematics. My passion lies in computational physics, where I explore numerical solutions to complex physical systems. Currently, I'm diving deep into Computational Field Theory, using numerical methods to tackle problems in Lattice QCD. I'm also keen on quantum computing and how it can revolutionize future technology. Aside from that I just have a general fascination with numbers, data, and math in general so I have also been trying to self-teach some data science/data analysis.
