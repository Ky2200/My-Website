title: Why i love Dr. Strange!

I love the movie Dr. Strange, so here is some information about it and why it got me into learning physics!

The magic in *Doctor Strange* (2016) is based on a blend of mysticism and quantum physics, offering a unique intersection of science fiction and fantasy. While it's fictional, some elements align with real-world physics, particularly ideas from quantum mechanics and multiverse theories.

Here are a few concepts that relate to the physics of *Doctor Strange*:

### 1. **Multiverse Theory**
In *Doctor Strange*, the Ancient One introduces the idea of multiple dimensions and realities that exist simultaneously, which is consistent with the concept of the multiverse in physics. The multiverse theory, especially in string theory and quantum mechanics, suggests that multiple, possibly infinite, universes exist in parallel, each with different physical laws or outcomes of quantum events.

- **Quantum Mechanics**: Quantum mechanics, particularly the "Many-Worlds Interpretation," posits that every quantum event branches into a new universe, where every possible outcome occurs. Doctor Strange's magic often taps into these parallel dimensions, which allows for extraordinary abilities, such as manipulating time or bending space.
